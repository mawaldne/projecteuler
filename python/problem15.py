problem15:

When going through the Grid, you can reduce it to an easier problem. 

For a 2 X 2, you are going to have all possible paths as 4 long, because you have to always go 2 down, and 2 right. 
So we have RRDD, RDRD, RDDR, DRDR, DDRR, DRRD - So 6 solutions. 

So now we have RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD to DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...Binomial Coefficient

40! / 20! * 20!
